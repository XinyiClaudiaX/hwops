      [ ] Disk space
      [ ] Memory capacity
      [ ] Network bandwidth
      [ ] Distinct servers
      [ ] Rack space

      What do you expect the increase of each of these to be each year?

  Additional request details:
    

Part V. Physical access

  [ ] All current maintainers already have card access to the SMR.
  [ ] The following additional maintainers will need card access to the SMR, to
      maintain this service:

Part I. Basic information

  Project name:    Hyades
  Server name:     RHOMBI
  Primary contact: Cel Skeggs
  Contact email:   sipb-hyades@mit.edu
  Owner list:      sipb-hyades-root@mit.edu
  Service level:
    [ ] production
    [X] development
  Description of the server's purpose:
    RHOMBI will be used as a build server so that members of the Hyades project
    who cannot build software locally can have a place to do so.
  Description of why neither Scripts nor XVM are appropriate:
    Neither are intended for heavy compute, which is the primary function of
    RHOMBI.
  Deployment timeline:
    We would like this server deployed within the next week, so that we can
    continue onboarding new contributors.
